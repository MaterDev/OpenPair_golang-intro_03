# OpenPair: Golang Intro 02

![Cover Image](./cover.png)

Building on my previous introductory exploration on the Go programming language (Golang), this repo delves deeper into some of the core concepts of Go. *This is part of a series to document and share my learning journey and for personal accountability. I hope you find it useful!*

## Overview

This repo extends the topics covered in the [OpenPair: Golang Intro](https://github.com/MaterDev/OpenPair_golang-intro). Accompanied by a [live stream video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc9ZF_3fuA0), it provides an interactive and in-depth exploration of the following concepts:

1. **Arrays**: Fixed-size, ordered collections of elements of a single type. The script shows how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays, including multi-dimensional arrays.
2. **Slices**: Dynamic and flexible segments of an array. The script explores slice creation, appending elements, and creating sub-slices, illustrating their dynamic nature compared to arrays.
3. **Maps**: Key-value pairs that provide a versatile way to store and manage data. The demonstration includes map creation, adding and removing elements, and iterating over maps.
4. **Structs**: Custom data types that allow the grouping of multiple fields under a single unit. The script illustrates defining structs, creating instances, and modifying their fields.
